# Height & Width of Images
![JAVASCRIPT](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PQHNOWFNS9o/XAkNsyPerCI/AAAAAAAALks/ONXxkKH3lRwskA3cfiqPa-cGKlt8u-l6wCLcBGAs/s1600/javascript.jpg)
You will also often see an element use two other attributes 
that specify its size:
height
This specifies the height of the 
image in pixels.
width
This specifies the width of the 
image in pixels.
Images often take longer to 
load than the HTML code that 
makes up the rest of the page. 
It is, therefore, a good idea to 
specify the size of the image 
so that the browser can render 
the rest of the text on the page 
while leaving the right amount of 
space for the image that is still 
loading .

## where to place images in your code . 
![Image](https://e3arabi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D8%A3%D8%B7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%A9-%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%A7-%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%AA.png)

Where an image is placed 
in the code will affect how it 
is displayed. Here are three 
examples of image placement 
that produce different results:
: before a paragraph
The paragraph starts on a new 
line after the image.
2: inside the start of a 
paragraph
The first row of text aligns with 
the bottom of the image.
3: in the middle of a 
paragraph
The image is placed between the 
words of the paragraph that it 
appears in. 

Where you place the image in 
the code is important because 
browsers show HTML elements 
in one of two ways:

* Block elements always appear 
on a new line. 

* Inline elements sit within a 
block level element and do not 
start on a new line . 

### aligns 
The align attribute was 
commonly used to indicate how 
the other parts of a page should 
flow around an image. It has 
been removed from HTML5 
and new websites should use 
CSS to control the alignment of 
images . 

The align attribute can take 
these horizontal values:
* left
This aligns the image to the left 
(allowing text to flow around its 
right-hand side).
* right
This aligns the image to the right 
(allowing text to flow around its 
left-hand side). 


#### Id attributes 
Every HTML element can carry 
the id attribute. It is used to 
uniquely identify that element 
from other elements on the 
page. Its value should start with 
a letter or an underscore (not a 
number or any other character).
It is important that no two 
elements on the same page 
have the same value for their id
attributes (otherwise the value is 
no longer unique).
If you go on to learn about 
JavaScript (a language that 
allows you to add interactivity to 
your pages), id attributes can be 
used to allow the script to work 
with that particular element.
The id attribute is known as a 
global attribute because it can 
be used on any element.

Class Attribute
Every HTML element can 
also carry a class attribute. 
Sometimes, rather than uniquely 
identifying one element within 
a document, you will want a 
way to identify several elements 
as being different from the 
other elements on the page. 
For example, you might have 
some paragraphs of text that 
contain information that is more 
important than others and want 
to distinguish these elements, or 
you might want to differentiate 
between links that point to other 
pages on your own site and links 
that point to external sites. 

Inline elements
Some elements will always 
appear to continue on the 
same line as their neighbouring 
elements. These are known as 
inline elements .

 #### Grouping Text & Elements In a Block
The <span> element acts like 
an inline equivalent of the <div>
element. It is used to either:
1. Contain a section of text 
where there is no other suitable 
element to differentiate it from 
its surrounding text
2. Contain a number of inline 
elements
The most common reason why 
people use <span> elements 
is so that they can control the 
appearance of the content of 
these elements using CSS.
You will usually see that a class
or id attribute is used with 
 elements:
* To explain the purpose of this 
 element .
* So that CSS styles can be 
applied to elements that 
have specific values for these attributes . 

#### IFRAMES
An iframe is like a little window 
that has been cut into your 
page — and in that window you 
can see another page. The term 
iframe is an abbreviation of inline 
frame.
* src : The src attribute specifies the 
URL of the page to show in the 
frame.
* height : The height attribute specifies 
the height of the iframe in pixels.
* width : The width attribute specifies 
the width of the iframe in pixels.

*  DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you 
are using.
*  You can add comments to your code between the markers.
*  The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
*  The 'div' and 'span' elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
* 'iframes' cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
*  The "meta" tag allows you to supply all kinds of 
information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special 
characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.
