# git
## Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.
## Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources.
## Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git.
## Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.
## Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.

committed | modified 
----------|----------
Data is securely stored in a local database |  File has been changed but not committed to the database
