### The JavaScript language. Here we learn JavaScript, starting from scratch and go on to advanced concepts like OOP. We concentrate on the language itself here, with the minimum of environment-specific notes. An introduction. An Introduction to JavaScript .

#### Operators
This chapter describes JavaScript's expressions and operators, including assignment, comparison, arithmetic, bitwise, logical, string, ternary and more.

* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Arithmetic operators
* Bitwise operators
* Logical operators
* String operators
* Conditional (ternary) operator
* Comma operator
* Unary operators
* Relational operators

##### loops 
Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.

* for statement
* do...while statement
* while statement
* labeled statement
* break statement
* continue statement
* for...in statement
* for...of statement

###### examples : 
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop A for statement looks as follows:
* for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement .

A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
* while (condition)
  statement .
