There are several types of information 
that need to be displayed in a grid or 
table. For example: sports results, stock 
reports, train timetables .
When representing information in a table, you need to think 
in terms of a grid made up of rows and columns (a bit like a 
spreadsheet). In this chapter you will learn how to:
*  Use the four key elements for creating tables
*  Represent complex data using tables
*  Add captions to tables 

## What's a Table?
A table represents information in a grid format. 
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV 
schedules, and sports results.
Grids allow us to understand 
complex data by referencing 
information on two axes . 
Each block in the grid is referred 
to as a table cell. In HTML a 
table is written out row by row . 
## Basic Table Structure 

The 'table' element is used 
to create a table. The contents 
of the table are written out row 
by row.
'tr'
You indicate the start of each 
row using the opening 'tr' tag. 
(The tr stands for table row.)

It is followed by one or more 
'td' elements (one for each cell 
in that row). 
At the end of the row you use a 
closing '/tr' tag.

'td'
Each cell of a table is 
represented using a 'td'
element. (The td stands for 
table data.)

## tables heading 

The 'th' element is used just 
like the 'td' element but its 
purpose is to represent the 
heading for either a column or 
a row. (The th stands for table 
heading.)

* The 'table' element is used to add tables to a web 
page.
*  A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created 
with the 'tr' element.
*  Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the 'td' element (or 'th' if it is a header).
