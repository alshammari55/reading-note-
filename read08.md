* Creating links between pages

* Linking to other sites

* Email links

 

## Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from 
one web page to another â€” enabling the 
very idea of browsing or surfing.

You will commonly come across the following types of links:
* Links from one website to another
* Links from one page to another on the same website
* Links from one part of a web page to another part of the 
same page
* Links that open in a new browser window
* Links that start up your email program and address a new 
email to someone Writing Links .

Links are created using the element . Users can click on anything between the opening tag and the closing tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the attribute.



IMDB (Links to an external site.) This is the page the link takes you to Opening link tag This is the text the user clicks on Closing link tag

Linking to Other Sites

Links are created using the element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link. Users can click on anything that appears between the opening tag and the closing tag and will be taken to the page specified in the href attribute. When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full web address for the site, which is known as an absolute URL

When you are linking to other 
pages within the same site, 
you do not need to specify the 
domain name in the URL. You 
can use a shorthand known as a 
relative URL.

## Directory Structure 

On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the 
pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a 
website are sometimes referred to as directories.

## Structure
The diagram on the right shows 
the directory structure for a 
fictional entertainment listings 
website called ExampleArts. 
The top-level folder is known 
as the root folder. (In this 
example, the root folder is called 
examplearts.) The root folder 
contains all of the other files and 
folders for a website. 
Each section of the site is placed 
in a separate folder; this helps 
organize the files.
Relationships
The relationship between 
files and folders on a website 
is described using the same 
terminology as a family tree. 
In the diagram on the right, you 
can see some relationships have 
been drawn in.
The examplearts folder is a 
parent of the movies, music
and theater folders. And the 
the movies, music and theater
folders are children of the 
examplearts folder.
Homepages
The main homepage of a site 
written in HTML (and the 
homepages of each section in a 
child folder) is called index.html.
Web servers are usually set up 
to return the index.html file if no 
file name is specified.
