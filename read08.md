# layouts 
In this chapter we are going to look at 
how to control where each element sits 
on a page and how to create attractive 
page layouts .

This involves learning about how designing for a screen can be 
different to designing for other mediums (such as print). In this 
chapter we will: 

* Explore different ways to position elements using normal 
flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats.

*  Discover how various devices have different screen sizes 
and resolution, and how this affects the design process.

*  Learn the difference between fixed width and liquid layouts, 
and how they are created.
*  Find out how designers use grids to make their page 
designs look more professional.

## Key Concepts in Positioning Elements

Building Blocks
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its 
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.
Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks 
of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can 
control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the 
boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use 
borders, margins, padding, and background colors. 

## Containing Elements
If one block-level element sits inside another 
block-level element then the outer box is 
known as the containing or parent element.
It is common to group a number of elements together inside a <div>
(or other block-level) element. For example, you might group together 
all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and 
the main navigation). The <div> element that contains this group of 
elements is then referred to as the containing element.
