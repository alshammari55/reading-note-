<html>
<body>
 <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
 <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of 
 the page. And if the page is a long one it might 
 be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
 <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help 
 you follow the structure of what is being written. 
 There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level 
 headings).</p>
 <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
</body>
</html>

The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled 
brackets — these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually 
made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag 
has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser 
something about the information that sits between its opening and 
closing tags.

## Body, Head & Title

<body>
You met the <body> element 
in the first example we created. 
Everything inside this element is 
shown inside the main browser 
window.
<head>
Before the <body> element you 
will often see a <head> element. 
This contains information 
about the page (rather than 
information that is shown within 
the main part of the browser 
window that is highlighted in 
blue on the opposite page). 
You will usually find a <title>
element inside the <head>
element.
<title>
The contents of the <title>
element are either shown in the 
top of the browser, above where 
you usually type in the URL of 
the page you want to visit, or 
on the tab for that page (if your 
browser uses tabs to allow you 
to view multiple pages at the 
same time).
  
  
X HTML pages are text documents.
X HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled 
brackets) to give the information they surround special 
meaning.
X Tags are often referred to as elements.
X Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes 
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes 
the end.
X Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more 
about the content of that element.
X Attributes require a name and a value.
X To learn HTML you need to know what tags are 
available for you to use, what they do, and where they 
can go.
  
This section discusses a process that 
you can use when you are creating a new 
website.
It looks at who might be visiting your site and how to ensure 
the pages feature the information those visitors need. It also 
covers some key aspects of design theory to help you create 
professional looking sites. In this chapter, we will look at:
● How to understand the audience your site may attract and 
what information they will expect to find on it
● How to organize information so that visitors can find what 
they are looking for
● Design theory for presenting information in a way that 
helps visitors achieve their goals
● Design tips to help you create more attractive and 
professional sites  

X It's important to understand who your target audience 
is, why they would come to your site, what information 
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
X Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
X Wireframes allow you to organize the information that 
will need to go on each page.
X Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps 
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
X You can differentiate between pieces of information 
using size, color, and style. 
X You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify 
the information you present.
