#LINKS

X Creating links between pages
X Linking to other sites
X Email links

Links are the defining feature of the web 
because they allow you to move from 
one web page to another — enabling the 
very idea of browsing or surfing.
You will commonly come across the following types of links:
● Links from one website to another
● Links from one page to another on the same website
● Links from one part of a web page to another part of the 
same page
● Links that open in a new browser window
● Links that start up your email program and address a new 
email to someone



Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything 
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify 
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.


<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>
This is the page the
link takes you to
Opening link tag
This is the text the
user clicks on
Closing
link tag

##Linking to Other Sites

inks are created using the <a>
element which has an attribute 
called href. The value of the 
href attribute is the page that 
you want people to go to when 
they click on the link.
Users can click on anything that 
appears between the opening 
<a> tag and the closing </a>
tag and will be taken to the page 
specified in the href attribute.
When you link to a different 
website, the value of the href
attribute will be the full web 
address for the site, which is 
known as an absolute URL.

-Linking to Other Pages 
on the Same Site

When you are linking to other 
pages within the same site, 
you do not need to specify the 
domain name in the URL. You 
can use a shorthand known as a 
relative URL.
If all the pages of the site are in 
the same folder, then the value 
of the href attribute is just the 
name of the file.
If you have different pages of a 
site in different folders, then you 
can use a slightly more complex 
syntax to indicate where the 
page is in relation to the current 
page. You will learn more about 
these on the pages 81-84.
If you look at the download 
code for each chapter, you will 
see that the index.html file 
contains links that use relative 
URLs.

Directory Structure

Structure
The diagram on the right shows 
the directory structure for a 
fictional entertainment listings 
website called ExampleArts. 
The top-level folder is known 
as the root folder. (In this 
example, the root folder is called 
examplearts.) The root folder 
contains all of the other files and 
folders for a website. 
Each section of the site is placed 
in a separate folder; this helps 
organize the files.
Relationships
The relationship between 
files and folders on a website 
is described using the same 
terminology as a family tree. 
In the diagram on the right, you 
can see some relationships have 
been drawn in.
The examplearts folder is a 
parent of the movies, music
and theater folders. And the 
the movies, music and theater
folders are children of the 
examplearts folder.
Homepages
The main homepage of a site 
written in HTML (and the 
homepages of each section in a 
child folder) is called index.html.
Web servers are usually set up 
to return the index.html file if no 
file name is specified. 
Therefore, if you enter 
examplearts.com it will return 
examplearts.com/index
.html, and examplearts.com/
music will return examplearts
.com/music/index.html.

Relative URLs

Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own 
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to 
find your files.

When you are linking to a page 
on your own website, you do 
not need to specify the domain 
name. You can use relative URLs
which are a shorthand way to tell 
the browser where a page is in 
relation to the current page.

X Links are created using the <a> element.
X The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate 
the page you are linking to.
X If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is 
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
X You can create links to open email programs with an 
email address in the "to" field.
X You can use the id attribute to target elements within 
a page that can be linked to.
