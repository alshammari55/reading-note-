X How to add images to pages
X Choosing the right format
X Optimizing images for the web

There are many reasons why you might 
want to add an image to a web page: you 
might want to include a logo, photograph, 
illustration, diagram, or chart.
There are several things to consider when selecting and 
preparing images for your site, but taking time to get them 
right will make it look more attractive and professional.
In this chapter you will learn how to:
● Include an image in your web pages using HTML
● Pick which image format to use
● Show an image at the right size
● Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages 
load faster . 

Choosing Images for 
Your Site . 

A picture can say a thousand words, and great 
images help make the difference between an 
average-looking site and a really engaging one.

Images can be used to set the 
tone for a site in less time than 
it takes to read a description. If 
you do not have photographs 
to use on your website, there 
are companies who sell stock 
images; these are images you 
pay to use (there is a list of stock 
photography websites below). 
Remember that all images are 
subject to copyright, and you 
can get in trouble for simply 
taking photographs from 
another website.
If you have a page that shows 
several images (such as product 
photographs or members of a 
team) then putting them on a 
simple, consistent background 
helps them look better as 
a group. 

Storing Images on 
Your Site

f you are building a site from scratch, it is good 
practice to create a folder for all of the images 
the site uses.
As a website grows, keeping 
images in a separate folder 
helps you understand how the 
site is organized. Here you can 
see an example of the files for 
a website; all of the images are 
stored in a folder called images.
On a big site you might like to 
add subfolders inside the images
folder. For example, images such 
as logos and buttons might sit in 
a folder called interface, product 
photographs might sit in a page 
called products, and images 
related to news might live in a 
folder called news.
If you are using a content 
management system or blogging 
platform, there are usually tools 
built into the admin site that 
allow you to upload images, 
and the program will probably 
already have a separate folder 
for image files and any 
other uploads . 


To add an image into the page 
you need to use an <img>
element, This is an empty 
element (which means there is 
no closing tag). It must carry the 
following two attributes:
src
This tells the browser where 
it can find the image file. This 
will usually be a relative URL 
pointing to an image on your 
own site. (Here you can see that 
the images are in a child folder 
called images — relative URLs . 
alt
This provides a text description 
of the image which describes the 
image if you cannot see it.
title
You can also use the title
attribute with the <img> element 
to provide additional information 
about the image. Most browsers 
will display the content of this 
attribute in a tootip when the 
user hovers over the image.


Old Code: Aligning 
Images Vertically

As you saw on the last page, the 
align attribute is no longer used 
in HTML5, but it is covered here 
because you may see it used in 
older websites and it is still used 
in the code created by some 
visual editors.
You can see how to use CSS 
to achieve the same effects on 
pages 285-286.
There are three values that the 
align attribute can take that 
control how the image should 
align vertically with the text that 
surrounds it:
top
This aligns the first line of the 
surrounding text with the top of 
the image.
middle
This aligns the first line of the 
surrounding text with the middle 
of the image.
bottom
This aligns the first line of the 
surrounding text with the bottom 
of the image . 


Three Rules for 
Creating Images
There are three rules to remember when you 
are creating images for your website which are 
summarized below. We go into greater detail 
on each topic over the next nine pages . 

1
Save images in 
the right format
Websites mainly use images in 
jpeg, gif, or png format. If you 
choose the wrong image 
format then your image might 
not look as sharp as it should 
and can make the web page 
slower to load.
2
Save images at 
the right size
You should save the image at 
the same width and height it will 
appear on the website. If 
the image is smaller than the 
width or height that you have 
specified, the image can be 
distorted and stretched. If the 
image is larger than the width 
and height if you have specified, 
the image will take longer to 
display on the page.
3
Use the correct
resolution
Computer screens are made up 
of dots known as pixels. Images 
used on the web are also made 
up of tiny dots. Resolution refers 
to the number of dots per inch, 
and most computer screens only 
show web pages at 72 pixels 
per inch. So saving images at 
a higher resolution results in 
images that are larger than 
necessary and take longer to 
download .
